# How to Fix the Large File Issue in Git

You're encountering this error because the file `Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh` (111.77 MB) exceeds GitHub's file size limit of 100MB. I've already updated your `.gitignore` file to prevent this file from being tracked in the future, but we need to remove it from your Git history.

## Option 1: Using git-filter-repo (Recommended)

This is the recommended approach by GitHub for removing large files from history.

1. First, install git-filter-repo:

```bash
# Using pip
pip install git-filter-repo

# Or using Homebrew on macOS
brew install git-filter-repo
```

2. Remove the large file from history:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the repository root directory
git filter-repo --path Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh --invert-paths
```

3. Force push the changes to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin --force
```

## Option 2: Using BFG Repo-Cleaner

BFG is another tool designed for cleaning Git repositories.

1. Download BFG from https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/

2. Run BFG to remove the large file:

```bash
# Replace path/to/bfg.jar with the actual path to the downloaded jar file
java -jar path/to/bfg.jar --delete-files Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh
```

3. Clean up and update the repository:

```bash
git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive
git push origin --force
```

## Option 3: Manual Approach (If the above options don't work)

If you're having trouble with the above methods, you can try this manual approach:

```bash
# Create a new branch from your current state
git checkout -b temp-branch

# Create a new orphan branch (no history)
git checkout --orphan new-main

# Add all files from your working directory
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Initial commit without large files"

# Delete the old branch
git branch -D main

# Rename the current branch to main
git branch -m main

# Force push to GitHub
git push -f origin main
```

This will create a new history without the large file, but it will lose your commit history.

## Prevention for the Future

1. I've already updated your `.gitignore` file to exclude the Miniconda installer.
2. For large files that you need to track, consider using [Git LFS (Large File Storage)](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
3. Always be cautious when committing binary files or installers to your repository.
