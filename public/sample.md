* Code blocks:

```python
import mlx.core as mx

# Create a simple tensor
x = mx.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
y = mx.array([5, 6, 7, 8])

# Perform operations
z = x + y
print(z)  # Output: [6, 8, 10, 12]
```

## Lists

1. Ordered lists
2. Unordered lists
   * Nested items
   * More nested items
3. And more!
